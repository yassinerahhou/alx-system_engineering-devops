Your code adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines for the most part. It is well-structured and follows recommended conventions. However, there is a minor issue with the comment at the end of your code. The comment is not formatted properly and contains a typo.

Here's the corrected version of your code, which addresses the issue with the comment:

python
Copy code

"""Data in the CSV format"""
import requests
from sys import argv

# Check if the script is being run as the main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/"
    user = requests.get(url + "users/{}".format(argv[1])).json()
    # Send an HTTP GET request to retrieve a list of tasks (todos) for the same user

    tasks = requests.get(url + "todos?userId={}".format(argv[1])).json()

    completed = []
    for i in tasks:
        if i.get("completed") is True:
            completed.append(i.get("title"))

    # EMPLOYEE_NAME: name of the employee
    EMPLOYEE_NAME = user.get("name")
    NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS = len(completed)  # Number of completed tasks

    # Number of completed tasks (completed + non-completed tasks)
    TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS = len(tasks)

    print("Employee {} is done with tasks({}/{}):".format(EMPLOYEE_NAME,
          NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS, TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS))
    for TASK_TITLE in completed:
